Question 2 - I'd add an endpoint to the notes which allows a user to update/edit a particular note. It was a logical method to add since the user already had the ability to get all/get by id/create/delete notes.

I would make this method a PATCH method, as patching is used to update a portion of the resource rather than replacing the entire resource which could cause some unexpected issues server side. An example URL for this endpoint could be: www.notes-server.com/notes/note/editNote/{id}

A payload returned from this endpoint could just be a simple success/failure boolean e.g:

{
  "success": true
}

----- EXAMPLE CONTROLLER W/ PATCH METHOD (Assuming MicroService is built using Java & SpringBoot) ------

@RestController
@RequestMapping(value = "/notes")
public class NotesController {

	@Autowired
	NotesService notesService;
 
 @RequestMapping(value = "/note/editNote/{noteUuid}",
					method = RequestMethod.PATCH,
					produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
	@ResponseBody
	public Map<String, boolean> updateNoteContent(@PathVariable("noteUuid") UUID noteUuid,
	                                                  @RequestBody Note noteToBeUpdated){
		return notesService.updateNotesContent(noteUuid, noteToBeUpdated);
	}
}
